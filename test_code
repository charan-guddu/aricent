what is the test code
So you’ve set up your tool.
Let’s resolve our first conflict that I created.
I have two branches. Master and charan
I created file called test.txt in both of charan
The content of the file in master branch is master and the content in the iss1 branch is charan
I committed those changes and now I am trying to merge iss1 into charan
